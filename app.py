"""
Home Meal Planner App - Simple At-Home Meal Plan Generator
- Inputs: TDEE (or compute from BMR stats) + activity level, days (1-7), meals/day, dietary prefs
- Output: Daily plan at 25% deficit, grocery list, and downloadable PDF (with per-meal steps)
- Embeddable UI (single-file Flask app using render_template_string)

How to run (Windows/macOS/Linux):
1) Install deps once:
   python -m pip install flask reportlab
2) Save this file as: home_meal_planner_app.py
3) Run server (safe mode avoids multiprocessing/threading issues):
   python home_meal_planner_app.py

If the environment blocks sockets (some sandboxes do), use OFFLINE mode:
   python home_meal_planner_app.py --offline --tdee 2400 --days 3 --meals 3 --activity light --out plan.pdf
   
Optional (full CPython with native extensions only):
   DEV_DEBUG=1 FLASK_THREADED=1 python home_meal_planner_app.py

Notes / Debugging:
- If you see ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_multiprocessing' or SystemExit(1) at startup, your env lacks native extensions or disallows threaded servers.
  The app runs single-process, non-threaded, and if the host refuses sockets it **falls back to OFFLINE generation** instead of crashing.
- If ReportLab isn't available, the PDF route responds with 501 and the offline mode will emit an HTML file you can print to PDF.
- This file avoids calling sys.exit(...) so sandbox runners that flag SystemExit won't error. The entrypoint now returns cleanly.
- Designed to be iframe-embeddable (set ALLOWED_EMBED_DOMAIN below if you want a strict CSP).
